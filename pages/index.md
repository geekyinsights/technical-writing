# Getting Started

When completing data analysis, you will often have to work with non-linear data. However, using regressions can make the task simpler and best of all you won't have to crossover math. 

This tutorial will break down the Random Forest regression model without jargon so that you can get started building a machine learning model.
 
We're going to cover: 
- What is a Random Forest?
- How to build a basic Random Forest Model.
- How to build Random Forest Models with Scikit-learn and Pandas.

There will be references to research articles and books throughout this guide so that you can understand the math. 

Target audience: Intermediate Python users
Time Requirement: 2 hours
